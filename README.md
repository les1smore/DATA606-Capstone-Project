# DATA 606 Capstone Project: Building Risk Prediction Models for Diabetes Using Machine Learning

## Background

**Severity**
Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. 

**Scale**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indicated that as of 2018, 34.2 million Americans have diabetes and 88 million have pre-diabetes. Diagnosed diabetes cost roughly $327 million dollars and total costs with undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes approaching $400 billion dollars annually.

**Significance**
Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment, making predictive models for diabetes risk important tools for public and public health officials.

## Literatrue Overview
- University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry built risk prediction models for Type 2 Diabetes using supervised ML models such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression models. (Xie et al, 2019)
- Department of Mathematics and Statistics from York University used threshold method and the class weight to improve sensitivity - the proportion of diabetes patients correctly predicted by models such as Decision Tree and Random Forest. (Lai et al, 2019)
- Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism from Peking University People's Hospital found that sex, age, history of diabetes, waist circumference, BMI, SBP were important risk factors related to diabetes. (Zhou et al, 2013)
- Insufficient sleep duration and/or sleep restriction in the laboratory, poor sleep quality, and sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea have all been associated with diabetes risk (Grandner, 2016). 

# Two Challenges 
*Challenge 1:* There is considerable heterogeneity in previous studies regarding machine learning techniques used, making it challenging to identify the optimal one. 
*Challenge 2:* There is a lack of transparency about the features used to train the models, which reduces their interpretability, a feature utterly relevant to the doctor.
